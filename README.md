# Restore Automatic (WIP)
A simple frontend for [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) that focus on upscaling and photo restoration using stable diffusions img2img capabilities.

For now it basically has the same kind of ui as sdwebui with some preset options but more features will be added soon, but its main goal is to stay simple and use what's already there with sdwebgui and stable diffusion.

As mentioned, it uses sdwebui as backend so you need to install it first and turn on API. 
The guide is provided in [Here](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-running) for all platforms.
You can [go here](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/API) for guide on how to enable API, this part is importent.
